# 42 C++ Modules

This repository contains solutions and exercises from the **C++ Modules** part of the 42 School curriculum. Each module explores key object-oriented programming concepts in C++98, building a strong foundation in clean, maintainable, and safe C++ code.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The C++ Modules at 42 are designed to teach:

* **Object-oriented programming**
* **Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism**
* **Memory management**
* **Abstract classes, interfaces**
* **Operator overloading**
* **Templates**
* **Exceptions**

All code is written in **C++98** standard, without using STL containers beyond what's allowed in the subject.

## 📁 Structure

```
.
├── Module00/   # Basic syntax, classes, member functions
├── Module01/   # Memory management, references, initialization lists
├── Module02/   # Inheritance, polymorphism
├── Module03/   # Abstract classes, interfaces
├── Module04/   # Operator overloading, casting
├── Module05/   # Exceptions, file I/O
├── Module06/   # Template functions and classes
├── Module07/   # More advanced templates
├── Module08/   # Containers and custom implementation (e.g., easyfind)
└── Module09/   # TBD if included
```

Each module contains:

* Source code and headers
* Subject PDF (if not confidential)
* Makefile
* Test cases and usage examples

## 🚀 Getting Started

To compile a module, navigate to its directory and run:

```bash
make
./program_name
```

## 📚 Prerequisites

* GCC or Clang with C++98 support
* Make
* Linux or macOS recommended

## 📎 Notes

* The modules were completed in a Unix environment, following 42's strict norm and coding standards.
* Error handling and memory management were implemented with great care.
